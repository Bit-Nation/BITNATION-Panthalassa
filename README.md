The Panthalassa mesh is the backend of the Pangea Jurisdiction. It's built using Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) protocols. This enables Pangea to be highly resilient and secure, even conferring resistance to emergent threats such as attacks based on high-performance quantum cryptography.
